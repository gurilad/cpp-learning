# c++ learning
this reposetory is for me to learn c++ and be able to learn it on diffrent devices


all explanasions for what each line does is inside the code 


# why am i learning c++
most of why im doing this is because im trying to make my own pc steering wheel and i thought the best way to start is to learn c++ so i can work with the items and actually build the code for it.

the other reason is that i think it could really help me with making any feauture projects.

another reason is because c++ is close to c and i might want to work with c and other languages close to this one in the feauture.
